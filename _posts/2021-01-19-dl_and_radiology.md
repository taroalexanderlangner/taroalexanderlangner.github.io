In 2016, Turing award winner Geoffrey Hinton remarked:

[*"I think if you work as a radiologist, you are like the coyote that is already over the edge of the cliff but hasn't yet looked down, so he doesn't realize there is no ground underneath him. People should stop training radiologists now. It's just completely obvious that within five years deep learning is going to be better [...]‚Äù*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HMPRXstSvQ)

These statements were received with varying levels of enthusiasm in computer science and the medical community. Two years later, the [Annual meeting of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine](https://www.ismrm.org/18m/), with an audience consisting mostly of medical professionals, featured a presentation slide that likened deep learning to a troll-like monster emerging from the woods.

Towards autumn of this year, the timeline predicted by Hinton is approaching its end. But how far has deep learning advanced in its ability to replace human experts in radiology?
